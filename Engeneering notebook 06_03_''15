Reflections:

Today we did some tests with the steering of the robot and try to find the ideal controls for steering with a 6x6 driving.
After testing the steering we did some tests with new wheels relative to the old ones.
We also came up with an idea for lifting balls into a bucket, and we're trying to find a solution to lift and grap the balls
in one action.
