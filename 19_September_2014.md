==============================
We’ve created a online platform for us and other teams so we can share information with each other. We've made a list of requirements for the robot so that the developers know what elements have to be in the robot. We also made some improvements at the robot, like wheels wich are builded in the matrix so they can’t be hitted by obstacles from outside.
