**Reflections:**

Today we brainstormed about the robot, without limitations. Our coatch Klaas had the idea to use a shark for this. Only the person who had the shark had the permission to talk. This worked out really well. There was more attention for the ideas of the speaker, and all ideas have been noted.

After that we followed the instructions of our coatch to properly connect the robot via Bluetooth. After that, we noticed that the controls defined a few weeks ago weren't ideal. We discussed with some teammates and we came to the conclusion that this has to change. Although we made a lot of progress, we didn't make a decission yet.
