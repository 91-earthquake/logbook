Tasks:

*try to make a lifting system on our final robot for the competition
*take a second look at the accelerationsensorprogram
*settle a 2 extra working days before the 26th of March

Reflections:

Before we started with our tasks, we discussed extra working days. This because we are short in time and need some extra days to work on our robot. We picked the dates March 8 and March 15. Aside from this, we though that it might be a good idea to do some work on the other days of the week if we have time for it.
After this, Jeroen, Mark and Caelin started to adjust the robot. The lifting system wasn't stable at first. We tried to solve this by adding some extra metal connection points. This partly solved the problem, but we're still working on it. 
We had some problems with the programming as well. This mainly because the robot wouldn't connect to our computer. There was something wrong with the driver, so we tried an other bluetoothstick to solve this. After this, we could continue our programming. Unfortunately this didn't go smooth as well. We're still working on our program and it seems to have improved. Next week, we will continue working on this program.
At last: we e-mailed the American FTC team Duct Tape, a team that had contact with Henk van der Wal in the last FTC season. After they've competed in their regional final, we will e-mail them again. It was fun to meet another team, especially a team from America
