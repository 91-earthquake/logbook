============================
We made our to-do list: We need to learn to program in RobotC, build the robot before the 5th of october. Everyone should look at the FTC rules, the FTC website en engineering notebook example before friday the 5th of september. Build the competition/match field (?). We need our router installed and programmed, we need to organize our workplace. Install sensors in NXT and EV3

We divided our team in a few groups: the group that will do the programming for the robot and the team that will design and build the robot. We will build the competition/match/game field together. We dedicided that Mark, Sil and Nora will do the programming and Jeroen en Sam will build the robot. Mark and Sybren will also film our team throughout the competition. 

To become closer as a team, we wanted to plan a field trip. This is probably going to take place in October/November. The definitive date isn't set yet.
Also, we made a few houserules for the team. For example: in our half our -break, we stay together and don't leave the building without a team member, every friday we meet from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m.
