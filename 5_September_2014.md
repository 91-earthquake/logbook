==============================
Today we had a first look at robotc. We first had a look at the IDE and the virtual world. With some help from the robotc wiki, we managed to control the robot with a Logitech controller. This was actually pretty easy, easier than we first thought. But fortunately, this isn’t all yet. Right now, we controlled a virtual robot, which was virtually ‘connected’ to the controller. If we manage to connect both the robot and the controller to a local WiFi or Bluetooth setup, we can actually control the robot wireless with a controller. And if that’s successful, we’re done for the last part of the game.
