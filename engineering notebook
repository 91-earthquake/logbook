Today we splitted up, me and Sibren tested the temperarely robot on driving. 
Me and Sibren worked on the wificonnection and  we've improved the motors.
Jeroen, Kaelin and Mark worked on a solution for picking the balls and lifting them up. They have an idea for a liftarm with a contraweight.
Nora has worked with the Acceleration sensor, she compared the output of standig on the remp with the output of the sensor with standing in front of the remp.
The result are not that accurate so she tries to improve that.
