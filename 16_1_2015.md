Coaches: Harry Doornbos & Klaas Kliffen

Guest: Henk Van Der Wal

Tasks:
-Reading the sensors of an EV3
-Controlling the robot with a remote
-Making the extendable arm for putting the balls into the tubes
-Making mechanisms to grab the tube 

Reflections:
The sensor didn't give the right numbers everytime. we tried to seperate to different results in different actions but wathever the result was it always ended up doing the same action.
The controlling of the robot did go well and Mark and Sibren can very easily move the robot(temperarely) around. They're drifting around the room!
The making of the other extendable arm didn't go really well. The parts were not prepared for screwing the screws. They are almost done.
After a few tries the grabbing mechanism as good as done. Caelin was trying really hard to cut the wood the right way. Also a hook was made to clamp the base of the tube.
