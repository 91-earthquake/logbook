Today we tried to connect de motors from Matrix with LEGO. That was for one part quite simple, the part to connect the LEGO to the motor itself. Difficulter was the part in which the LEGO connect with the axis. That took quite some time and it is a bit large, so we probebly don't use it in future. On the other side connecting the LEGO with the motor itself was easy and we can use that maybe.
With programming we tried to program the compass sensor but that failed. It turns out the compass sensor does only works when there is no metal and the robot is almost entirely made out of metal, so we're looking for something else to use the sensor for.
