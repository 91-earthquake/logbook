Task:

* Adjusting our robot. We had a few ideas and this day, we wanted to try some of them
* Making a programming plan. At first, we didn't have a clear vision of what we could program
* Watching videos of other teams


Reflection:

Today we started relatively early. We began at 11 o'clock. We started with adjusting our robot. We had the idea of having the robot grab one of the rolling goals and get it on top of the Platform. Because we want to do this, we would have to adjust the heigt of the robot. We also checked the Sizing Box. We dediced to make our Sizing Box a bit smaller, so we would be sure that the robot would fit in. Unfortunately, we didn't have the right material for the Sizing Box, leaving us to make the Sizing Box another time (probably next week).
While working on the robot and making it a bit bigger, the robot became unstable. We had to find a way to make the robot stable again. We managed to make it stable by putting an extra bar of the Matrix material to it. This fixed the problem. 
After this, it was time to look at the program. We thought it would be helpful to make a "program plan" In this plan, we set up a few scenarios in which our robot could start and what our robot should do in each of these scenarios. With this sorted out, we now know how what our program should contain in order to complete the actions we described in our scenarios.
