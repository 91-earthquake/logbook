Attendence: Jeroen Aalders,Nora Migdad & Sam Hengeveld

Coaches: Harry Doornbos & Klaas Kliffen

Guests: Gertjan Rocks & Sven van Laar

Tasks:

- Fix the robot with driving and liftarm lifting
- Thinking about a grabbing mechanism

Reflection: We were only with a few of our team so we have not done very much. The wheels doesn't jam anymore. They're now moving very slightly.
We also filed a few screws so the liftarm also doesn't jam.
For the ball-grabbing mechanism we came up with street sweeper brushes. The launch the balls in a little container. In that container can fit 4 balls en then we will put it into the highest tube.
